            <p>When picking out skincare, questions like “Is this for me?” or “Is this good for MY skin?” 
                crosses your mind. This prompted us to create a recommendation system with products found within your local
                 Sephora. The target of this information is people with dry and oily skin.  
                 This recommendation will also be beneficial to people with combination skin,
                 which is a mix of dry and oily skin types. We obtained data from Kaggle.com. Then, performed 
                 the Cluster Sampling 
                 Method as we divided the population into clusters. 
                 We chose 5 labels out of 6 then the content of the 5 labels was 
                randomly picked. Resulting in getting 50 samples from the original population. The data set includes the label, 
                brand of the product, the price in USD, compatibility with dry and oily skin, and ratings. With these variables,
                 you’ll be able to figure out which product is suitable for you and your skin.
